            Social technologies and major life transitions / events
        <p>
        Each person faces many transitions throughout their life as they develop, age, and change. 
        Yet people often find it difficult to manage where and how to present and discuss life transitions and changing identities on social media sites, and to find communities of similar others. 
        These difficulties are often amplified for those with marginalized or stigmatized identities (e.g., transgender and other LGBQ people, first generation and low-income college students). 
        This line of research addresses these concerns via a wide range of methods. 
        We seek to explain how people fragment their identities and networks among separate social media sites during major life transitions, and the social inequities that exist for people with marginalized identities, particularly those with multiple intersecting marginalized identities, during major life transitions (among other outcomes).

            Gender transition and social media
            <p>
            Social computing technologies, such as social media sites, often privilege people who fit within expected and unchanging categories. 
            Thus, designing technology and social media flexible enough to allow for representation of complex identities that emerge as people embark on major life transitions, such as changing gender, is a particular challenge. 
            Because little is known about how transgender people navigate gender transition on social media, this work seeks to understand challenges and opportunities related to this experience. 
            Examining the relationships between issues including disclosure, self-presentation, emotional wellbeing, and social support on social media sites for transgender and non-binary users is fundamentally important on its own accord, 
            but can also inform technology design that will benefit people who struggle with navigating a wide range of major identity changes online.

          Online spaces and sensitive populations
          <p>Online spaces can be important platforms for people from sensitive, stigmatized, and vulnerable populations to discuss their problems and find support; yet platform design decisions impact how people present themselves and interact with others. 
            By studying these groups' online self-presentation and disclosure practices, along with the politics of social media platform design, 
            we can understand how to design technology to better support those facing difficult issues like sexual abuse, relationship breakups, eating disorders, depression, and gender presentation.
